# Arduino-Sonar-Project
This is the repo for an Arduino Sonar Project I made. It contains all the code used including the .ino and .py files used in the programming of this project.
The sonar was quite small, using a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and a microservo with some 3D printed parts. It had a maximum range of 60cm.
